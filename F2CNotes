Need to define xargc an xargv as neeed in libf2c. They are C in the output of nm
but not actually defined.  This allows the code to dyn.load() into R.

Added definitions for s_stop and sig_die() to proxies to ensure that calls to these do not
terminate the R process, but instead raise an R error.

Compile libf2c.a with -g flag so we can debug.

gettim and getdat are non-portable FORTRAN routines for getting the time (hour, min, secs) and date (year, month, day)
These seem to be used for writing information for the user.
