# Goals
 Allow the caller to specify inputs as files, i.e., keep the current file-based interface
 but allow more flexibility to specify each file by name, not just the directory and fixed file names.
  (This at least deals with capitalization issues)

 Allow the caller specif

 Allow the caller set the values of some of the parameters not accessible via vile inputs (if there are any of these we care about)



Add checkInterrupts within the loop. R_CheckUserInterrupt(void)

# Strategy


We convert the .f files to .c via f2c
 We don't have to as we can directly call FORTRAN code from R.
 However, to do the programmatic analysis we want to do, it is much easier to have the
 code in C.

We compile the resulting C code with access to f2c.h. So we add
the relevant path to the compiler includes.
This may need to be done via autoconf.

We link the shared library against libf2c.{a/so}.

For Linux (and all platforms as a result), we change the name
of the MAIN__ routine to something else to avoid conflicts
with main() in the R executable.
This is to do with how the loader resolves symbols and this is platform
dependent and also related to the linker.


f2c creates many static variables both in individual .c files
and also within resulting C routines.

  1) We should first determine if any of these are constant, i.e. are they ever changed.
  e.g. c__30 - the first static in INPUT.c
       A reference/pointer to that is passed to igetfileversion() (#152), so its value is modified.
       Where else is it used however.

  2) Are the  variables used outside of a single routine?
      e.g. c__33 is defined at the file-level, but only used within meteoin()
         c__33 is also used in a call to iggetfileversion()

  3) Are the values reinitialized on each run through the code starting at our entry point?




# To run from R
+ Call R_init().
+ Allow caller to specify values for any of the variables and set just these after the call to init().
  Do this separately so can do it separately from R_init(), i.e. after we read any input files or set the data.
+



## Collecting the Results
Do we collect all the information across all iterations and then return to R
Or do we let the C code write to a file and read it back in later?

+ How much output will there be?
+ Do we want to deal with it in chunks?
+ Can we guess the numnber of rows and preallocate sensibly?




## init() routine

In init() in INPUT.c, we have 4 static variables
  i__, js, inob, lseep.

lseep is initialized to FALSE_, but is never referenced elsewhere.
Similarly inob is never used.
There are many references to i__ in the C files, but these are probably references
to a different i__.

js is used as a counter within a loop.


Some of the inputs to init_() are (references to) arrays and not scalars,
e.g. ntab





#################
Does basinf_ read the SELECTOR.in file - Yes.
The Hydrus1d manual is helpful with types and variables and explanations.

Reading the FORTRAN code:
file version
skip 2 lines - BLOCK A.... & Heading  
Read Hed =  Welcome to HYDRUS-1D
Read the LUnit......  declaration (literal "LUnit  TUnit  MUnit  (indicated units are obligatory for all input data)")
Then read each of the 3 values - lunit, tunt, munit into LUint, TUnit, MUnit - local variables.
Then call conversion for the units for LUnit and TUnit.

Then skip the lWat lChem ..... line
Then read values t t f t t .... for each of these up to lEquil - set all of these variables.
For version 4 file format, read snow, upto flux and set all these variables

If lSnow and !lTemp - lSnow = FALSE

Read NMat, NLay, CosAlf - all seem to be integers
Compare NMat > NMatD || NLay > 10 - PROBLEM


Eat BLOCK B & MaxIt ....  header lines
Read MaxIt, TolTh, TolH
Eat next header line TopInf ...
Read TopInF, WLayer, KodTop, lInitW  - KodTop is an integer it appears? The others are logicals.

KodTop == 0 => lVarBC = TRUE

Eat the header line:
Read BotInF,qGWLF,FreeD,SeepF,KodBot,qDrain,hSeep


if(!TopInf & KodTop == -1) || (!BotInf && KodBot == -1 && !qGWLF && !FreeD & !SeepF && !qDrain) 
    EAT a line
     Read rTop, rBot, RRoot, (hCritS, hCritA)?
else rTop = rBot = rRoot = 0
if(qGWLFF) - eat line, read GWLO0L, Aqh, Bqh
if(qDrain) - Eat, read iPosDr, Eat, read zBotDr, rSpacing, Entres
zBotDr = -abs(zBotDr)
EAT
switch(iPosDr 
  1: read rKhTop
  2  read BaseGW, rKhTop, WetPer
  3 BaseGW,rKhTp,rKhBot, WetPer
  4

Reading Profile.dat

The FORTRAN code is easier to read than the f2c'ed C code doing the input.
Also, read the manual for HYDRUS1d for the format. Page 206 for PROFILE.dat

This is done in INPUT.c by the nodinf_ routine.

The file/unit is opened in HYDRUS.c and uses unit 32 (in the variable c__32).

The Profile.dat file 
starts with File version info. Skip this.
Then an integer giving the number of lines of following data.
These seem to get skipped.  VERIFY - yes.

Then the line
  300    1    2    0 x         h      Mat  Lay      Beta           Axz            Bxz            Dxz          Temp          Conc            SConc

300 -> numnp is set by do_lio INPUT.c::1393
This is the number of lines of data in the table.

1 -> ii 

2 -> ns

Compare nump to numnpd and ns to nsd


If !*lchem is false.
Otherwise if *lchem and *ltemp, we would read the values  for
 x, h, Mat, Lay, Beta, .., Dxz but apparently not Temp Conc and SConc.

Otherwise, if !*lchem - still false, read all from x, h .. Temp

If *lequil - false - read x, h, ,  Temp and then read *ns reals from the reminder of the line.
In this case, *ns = 2. THese are Conc and SConc.

Otherwise  read x, h, ... Temp,  *ns reals from the same line and then *ns more reals.
These first *ns reals go into c__[ ii - 1] where ii is the index 1...*ns.
The other *ns go into  &s[ii] 

Then @1639-1659 set these values for this record
we set n, x[n], hold[n], matnum, etc.

*ns - number of solutes (?)


Passing address of the variable and it magically becomes a pointer to a "flex".
See libf2c and lread.c specifically.

What does e_rsle do ?  ?? Skip to the end of the line
          s_rsle()?
