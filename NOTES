- Find entry point - HYDRUS.c?
- RCIndex  - make call graph, Understand program
- Look to see if this has been done before - both specifically for HYDRUS and also for FORTRAN code.
See if there a tutorial - python, matlab, R, standalone executable

1. Get *.in files - put these in package
2. R_hydrus_simple(SEXP r_args)
   xargc - dim
   xargv - strings
   MAIN__()
3. R_set_* data: One for each *.in
   What does each create?
   Define structure

   mkATMOS, mkWATER
   
4. R_hydrus_complex(a, b, c, d, ...)
